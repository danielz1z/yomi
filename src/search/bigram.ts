 * CJK-aware bigram preprocessing for FTS5 indexing/querying.

 * The FTS5 `unicode61` tokenizer has no Chinese/Japanese/Korean word
 * segmentation: a whole CJK run collapses into a single opaque token, so a
 * two-character CJK substring inside a longer CJK term never matches. Yomi has no ICU
 * tokenizer available and takes on no new dependency to get one, so instead
 * both the indexed text and the search query are rewritten into overlapping
 * character bigrams for CJK runs before ever reaching FTS5. Overlapping
 * overlapping bigrams preserve exact two-character search terms inside longer CJK text
 * (itself a single bigram once transformed) becomes a plain token match.
 * This covers the common case of 2+ character CJK words; single-character
 * CJK terms still match via the emitted unigram.
 *
 * Non-CJK runs (Latin, digits, punctuation) are left untouched and keep
 * relying on unicode61's normal whitespace/punctuation tokenization.
