/**
 * The insight layer's first stage: build structured, unsupervised context for
 * an agent to reason over — it does not decide what needs attention itself.
 *
 * The division of labour is deliberate. Determining whether a message is an
 * open request or a closing acknowledgement is illocutionary force, which topic
 * embeddings provably do not encode (see ./pending), so no amount of clustering
 * or scoring here can decide "needs attention" without guessing. Instead this
 * stage assembles what CAN be computed without content understanding — the
 * relationship graph (./relationships), reply rhythm (./rhythm), and the
 * candidate pending items with their thread context (./pending) — and returns
 * it as a package. The agent consuming the tool makes the final call, grounded
 * in that context rather than in a raw message dump.
