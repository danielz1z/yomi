/**
 * Yomi MCP `login`/`login_complete` handlers.
 *
 * Split out of handlers.ts purely to keep that file (the general tool
 * handler surface) under the project's 500-scc-line module cap; behavior
 * owned here is otherwise unchanged in spirit from what previously lived
 * inline there.
 *
 * Two login paths exist, dispatched by client capability:
 *
 *   - Elicitation clients: the original single-call flow — elicit phone/
 *     region, elicit PIN acknowledgement, block to completion. Unchanged.
 *
 *   - Non-elicitation clients (e.g. Claude Desktop, confirmed empirically —
 *     it does not support MCP elicitation): the PIN has nowhere to go if we
 *     block, since it is produced mid-flow and stderr is invisible to the
 *     human, but a tool RESULT is visible. So the flow is split across two
 *     tool calls: `login` starts the passwordless flow and returns the PIN
 *     as soon as LINE issues it (bounded wait), then `login_complete`
 *     awaits the same in-flight login to finish once the human has acted
 *     on their phone.
 *
 * Both paths call the ONE shared login sequence in ../cli/login.ts
 * (`runPwlessLogin`) — neither duplicates it.
