    description: `Log in to LINE via the passwordless secondary-device flow. Requires ${PRIMARY_DEVICE_SETTING_PATH} enabled on the primary phone — with it off LINE never prompts that phone and NO login can succeed, so raise this with the human up front rather than after a failure. On MCP clients with form elicitation, this call first confirms that setting, then prompts for phone/region and PIN and completes login by itself; if the human says the setting is off, it returns the enabling steps without starting a login (relay them verbatim, then call \`login\` again). On clients without it (e.g. Claude Desktop), phone/region come from the arguments or a persisted login, and this returns as soon as LINE issues the PIN (or reports none needed) — then call login_complete IMMEDIATELY (do not wait for the human). LINE gives ~3 minutes from PIN display to confirm on the phone; login_complete blocks past that, so calling it late only wastes that window.`,
