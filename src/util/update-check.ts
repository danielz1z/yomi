/**
 * "Is this copy of Yomi out of date?" — asked once at startup, answered to
 * the model through the MCP `instructions` so it can tell the human.
 *
 * Why this exists: the drag-and-drop `.mcpb` bundle has NO auto-update. The
 * MCPB manifest spec defines no update URL or endpoint (its `version` is
 * plain metadata), and Claude Desktop only auto-updates extensions installed
 * from the official directory — "for privately distributed extensions, users
 * will need to install updated .mcpb files manually". Yomi's bundles are
 * attached to GitHub Releases, so without this a user can sit on an old
 * build indefinitely without ever knowing.
 *
 * It cannot self-update: a bundle carries native binaries (onnxruntime-node,
 * sharp) and overwriting itself while running is neither safe nor portable.
 * Telling the human, with the right link for how they installed, is the whole
 * scope.
 *
 * PRIVACY. This is the ONE outbound request Yomi makes that is not to LINE,
 * and it is disclosed in PRIVACY.md. It sends no message content and no
 * account identifier — it is a plain GET of a public npm registry document.
 * What it does reveal to the registry is that some IP is running Yomi, and
 * (by what it does with the answer) roughly which version. `YOMI_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`
 * turns it off completely.
