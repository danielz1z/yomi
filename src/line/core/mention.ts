/**
 * LINE outbound @mention wire format — `contentMetadata.MENTION`.
 *
 * Reverse-engineered from two real inbound group messages captured by the
 * operator (see the task ground truth, not restated here). Established
 * facts, and nothing beyond them:
 *
 * - `contentMetadata.MENTION` is a JSON *string* whose parsed shape is
 *   `{ MENTIONEES: [{ M, S, E }, ...] }`.
 * - `M` is the mentioned user's MID; `S`/`E` are the start/end offsets as
 *   *strings*, not numbers.
 * - The range is half-open `[S, E)`, measured in UTF-16 code units — i.e.
 *   plain JavaScript string indices (a three-code-unit name plus `@` matched `S:"0", E:"4"`).
 * - Key order inside a mentionee object is not significant.
 * - MENTION rides in `contentMetadata`, which is never part of an E2EE
 *   ciphertext payload — it was observed in the clear on a real message.
 *
 * This module only builds and validates that wire shape. It does not
 * resolve display names to MIDs (that guess is out of scope — see
 * `find_contact`/`get_group_members`), and it does not extend the format
 * with anything not listed above.
 */

/**
 * One outbound mention: a mid plus the half-open `[start, end)` UTF-16
 * offset range into the message text that mid's `@name` occupies.
 *
 * Numbers, not strings, at this boundary — the wire format's `S`/`E`
 * strings are a serialization detail `buildMentionMetadata` handles, not
 * something callers should have to think about.
